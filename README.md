The Collatz conjecture states that, for any positive integer n, it will eventually reach 1 by repeatedly applying the following procedure:

If n is even, divide it by 2.
If n is odd, multiply by 3 and then add 1.
The number of steps needed for n to reach 1 is called its stopping time. 

Print the stopping times of all the numbers from 1 to 1,000 inclusive, each on their own line.
