 Examples from 'Advent of Code (2022)' Challenges 
 ### [day-8](./advent-of-code-2022/day-8/)

## code-golf

Solutions to problems from [code.golf](https://code.golf)

### [roman-to-arabic](./code-golf/roman-to-arabic)

programs to convert roman numerals to arabic numerals

### [diamonds](./code-golf/diamonds)

Draw a size ascending range of diamonds using the numbers 1 to 9, ranging from size 1 to size 9, each diamond separated by a blank line.

### [united-states](./code-golf/united-states)

Given each US state (and a federal district) print the corresponding US Postal Service abbreviation.

### [christmas-trees](./code-golf/christmas-trees)

Draw a size ascending range of Christmas trees using asterisks, ranging from size 3 to size 9, each tree separated by a blank line.

### [collatz](./code-golf/collatz)

The Collatz conjecture states that, for any positive integer n, it will eventually reach 1 by repeatedly applying the following procedure:

If n is even, divide it by 2.
If n is odd, multiply by 3 and then add 1.
The number of steps needed for n to reach 1 is called its stopping time. 

Print the stopping times of all the numbers from 1 to 1,000 inclusive, each on their own line.#

### [cubes](./code-golf/cubes)

Draw 7 cubes in increasing size using "╱" (U+2571) for the diagonal edges, "│" (U+2502) for the vertical edges, "─" (U+2500) for the horizontal edges, and "█" (U+c) for the vertices. The cubes should range from size 1 to size 7 with a blank line between each cube.

### [fizz-buzz](./code-golf/fizz-buzz)

Print the numbers from 1 to 100 inclusive, each on their own line.

If, however, the number is a multiple of three then print Fizz instead, and if the number is a multiple of five then print Buzz.

If multiple conditions hold true then all replacements should be printed, for example 15 should print FizzBuzz.

### [day-of-the-week](./code-golf/day-of-the-week)

Given a date in the YYYY-MM-DD format between 1583-01-01 and 9999-12-31 inclusive, output the English name of the corresponding day of the week.
