## brief

Using pipes and underscores print the argument as if it were displayed on a seven segment display.

For example the number 0123456789 should be displayed as:
```
 _     _  _     _  _  _  _  _
| |  | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|
|_|  ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _|
```

## main.py

Here I used ChatGPT for 2 questions early on with 'what's wrong here?'- I had not converted my inout to int and I had not initially used the correct syntax for accessing values in my nested dictionary.
