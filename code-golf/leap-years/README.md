## Brief

In the Gregorian calendar, a leap year is created by extending February to 29 days in order to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical year. These longer years occur in years which are multiples of 4, with the exception of centennial years that arenâ€™t multiples of 400.

## main.py

This was my intiial working version. I didn't need any 'help' with the syntax for functions but I was distracted and did not have a clear view for the evaluation logic initially.

## main-improved.py

I asked ChatGPT 

> could this leap year code be more efficient
 
along with a copy of the code and ChatGPT provided this with the explanation

> This code uses a single `if` condition to check for leap years, making it more concise and easier to read.


### main.go

I attempted to translate this to golang. I got the syntax for the loop for the years and the check logic but I reverted to chatgpt for a sane single loop on this occasion
