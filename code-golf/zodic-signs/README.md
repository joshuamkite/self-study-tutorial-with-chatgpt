## Brief

Given a MM-DD HH:MM date and time, output the corresponding Zodiac sign symbol according to the first table below. If the ascending sign is different from the Zodiac sign (sun sign), output it as well. Approximate the ascending sign using the sun sign and time according to the second table below.

Sign Symbol Date

Aries	♈	March 21 – April 19
Taurus	♉	April 20 – May 20
Gemini	♊	May 21 – June 21
Cancer	♋	June 22 – July 22
Leo	♌	July 23 – August 22
Virgo	♍	August 23 – September 22
Libra	♎	September 23 – October 22
Scorpio	♏	October 23 – November 22
Sagittarius	♐	November 23 – December 21
Capricorn	♑	December 22 – January 19
Aquarius	♒	January 20 – February 18
Pisces	♓	February 19 – March 20

After several iterations from asking ChatGPT to make the golfed code more efficient. Easier to read but only 1 place improved on CodeGolf. ChatGPT explains:

Certainly! The revised code maintains the functionality of your original code while making some improvements for readability and efficiency. Here's a breakdown:

### Original Code vs. Revised Code

#### Original Code:

1. **Dictionaries for Zodiac Signs**: You used two dictionaries `D` and `N` to map date and time ranges to zodiac signs. This is accurate but a bit verbose.
  
2. **Multiple Loops and Dictionary Comprehensions**: You used dictionary comprehensions inside loops to filter out the zodiac signs based on the date and time. This is computationally more expensive.

3. **Multiple Variables**: You used a lot of intermediate variables (`g`, `t`, `u`, `w`, `s`, etc.), which can make the code harder to follow.

4. **Complex Print Logic**: You used an `if-else` statement to decide what to print, which adds extra lines to the code.

#### Revised Code:

1. **Simplified Dictionaries**: The dictionaries `D` and `N` are simplified to only include the necessary date and time ranges, making it easier to read and understand.

2. **Efficient Lookup**: Used the `max()` function with a generator expression to find the appropriate zodiac sign based on the date and time. This avoids the need for dictionary comprehensions and is more efficient.

3. **Reduced Variables**: The number of intermediate variables is reduced, making the code more straightforward.

4. **Simplified Print Logic**: Used a single `print` statement with a conditional expression to output the result, reducing the number of lines.

### Summary

The revised code is more efficient in terms of computational complexity and is easier to read and understand due to fewer lines and simpler logic. It maintains all the functionality of the original code while being more streamlined.
