## Brief

Brainfuck is a minimalistic esoteric programming language created by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993.

Assuming an infinitely large array, the entire brainfuck alphabet matches the following pseudocode:

```
>	ptr++
<	ptr--
+	array[ptr]++
-	array[ptr]--
.	print(chr(array[ptr]))
[	while(array[ptr]){
]	}
```

Write a program that will receive various brainfuck programs as arguments and execute each program in turn.

## main.py

Here I did not even attempt to solve the problem myself, I gave ChatGPT the above brief and the first solution offered passed:

> Certainly! Here's a Python program that interprets Brainfuck code:
> 
> ```python
> def brainfuck_interpreter(bf_code):
>     # Initialize the array and pointers
>     array = [0] * 30000
>     ptr = 0
>     i = 0
> 
>     # Helper function to find the matching bracket
>     def find_matching_bracket(code, index, direction):
>         count = 1
>         while count > 0:
>             index += direction
>             if code[index] == '[':
>                 count += direction
>             elif code[index] == ']':
>                 count -= direction
>         return index
> 
>     # Execute the Brainfuck code
>     while i < len(bf_code):
>         char = bf_code[i]
>         if char == '>':
>             ptr += 1
>         elif char == '<':
>             ptr -= 1
>         elif char == '+':
>             array[ptr] += 1
>         elif char == '-':
>             array[ptr] -= 1
>         elif char == '.':
>             print(chr(array[ptr]), end="")
>         elif char == '[':
>             if array[ptr] == 0:
>                 i = find_matching_bracket(bf_code, i, 1)
>         elif char == ']':
>             if array[ptr] != 0:
>                 i = find_matching_bracket(bf_code, i, -1)
>         i += 1
> 
> if __name__ == "__main__":
>     # Receive various Brainfuck programs as arguments
>     import sys
>     for bf_program in sys.argv[1:]:
>         brainfuck_interpreter(bf_program)
> ```
> 
> To use the program:
> 
> 1. Save the code above to a file, say `bf_interpreter.py`.
> 2. Run the program with Brainfuck code as arguments. For example:
> ```
> python bf_interpreter.py "++[>++++[>++<-]<-]>>."
> ```
> 
> This will print the letter 'A' as the output. You can pass multiple Brainfuck programs as arguments, and the interpreter will execute each one in turn.
