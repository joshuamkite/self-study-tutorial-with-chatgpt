# Brief

Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as  space-separated strings on a single line.

Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.

## ChatGPT improvements suggestions

> The code you provided takes an integer > `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes a string `n` and separates its characters into two lists: `even` and `odd`, based on their indices. Finally, it prints the characters from the even indices followed by the characters from the odd indices.

> Here are some improvements to make the code more concise and readable:
>
> 1. Use list comprehensions for a more concise way to separate even and odd indexed characters.
> 2. Avoid using single-letter variable names; use more descriptive names.
> 3. Use a single loop to iterate through the string and separate the characters based on their indices.

>     s = input().strip()
>     even_chars = [s[i] for i in range> (0, len(s), 2)]
>     odd_chars = [s[i] for i in range> (1, len(s), 2)]
>     print(''.join(even_chars), ''.join> (odd_chars))

> The improved code I provided is more concise and readable, but in terms of computational efficiency, both the original and the improved code have the same time complexity.

> Let's break it down:
>
> 1. Both versions iterate through the string `n` twice: once for even indices and once for odd indices. This results in a time complexity of O(2n) for this operation, which simplifies to O(n).
> 
> 2. The use of list comprehensions in the improved code doesn't change the time complexity. List comprehensions are generally faster than traditional for-loops in Python due to their optimized implementation, but the overall time complexity remains O(n).
> 
> 3. Both versions use the `join` method to concatenate the characters, which also has a time complexity of O(n).
> 
> In summary, while the improved code is more concise and may have some minor performance improvements due to the use of list comprehensions, the overall computational efficiency in terms of time complexity remains the same for both versions: O(n).
