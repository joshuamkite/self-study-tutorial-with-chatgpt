# Day 19: Interfaces

## Objective
Today, we're learning about Interfaces. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task
The `AdvancedArithmetic` interface and the method declaration for the abstract `divisorSum(n)` method are provided for you in the editor below.

Complete the implementation of `Calculator` class, which implements the `AdvancedArithmetic` interface. The implementation for the `divisorSum(n)` method must return the sum of all divisors of `n`.

### Example
The divisors of `6` are `1, 2, 3, 6` and their sum is `12`.
The divisors of `12` are `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12`. Their sum is `28`.

## Input Format
A single line with an integer, `n`.

## Constraints
- (The constraints are not provided in the extracted text.)

## Output Format
You are not responsible for printing anything to stdout. The locked template code in the editor below will call your code and print the necessary output.

### Sample Input
```
6
```

### Sample Output
```
I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic
12
```

### Explanation
The integer `6` is evenly divisible by `1, 2, 3, 6`. Our `divisorSum` method should return the sum of these numbers, which is `12`. The `Solution` class then prints `I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic` on the first line, followed by the sum returned by `divisorSum` (which is `12`) on the second line.
