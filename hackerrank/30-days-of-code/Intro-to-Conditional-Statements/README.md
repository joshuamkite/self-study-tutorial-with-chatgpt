## Brief

### Objective
In this challenge, we learn about conditional statements. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-conditional-statements/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video.

### Task
Given an integer \( n \), perform the following conditional actions:

- If \( n \) is odd, print `Weird`
- If \( n \) is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print `Not Weird`
- If \( n \) is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print `Weird`
- If \( n \) is even and greater than 20, print `Not Weird`

### Input Format
A single line containing a positive integer \( n \).

### Constraints
(Constraints were not provided)

### Output Format
Print `Weird` if the number is weird; otherwise, print `Not Weird`.

#### Sample Input 0
```
3
```

#### Sample Output 0
```
Weird
```

#### Sample Input 1
```
24
```

#### Sample Output 1
```
Not Weird
```

#### Explanation
Sample Case 0: \( n = 3 \) is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print `Weird`.

Sample Case 1: \( n = 24 \) and is even, so it is not weird. Thus, we print `Not Weird`.
